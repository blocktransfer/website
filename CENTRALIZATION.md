# What is centralized?

While the root directory site here is open-source and avaliable for the general public to comment, audit, and interact with&mdash;**the main www.blocktransfer.com website is centralized.**

We host this site through Zoho, which the Syndicate uses to manage sensative internal operations such as emergency regulatory communications, management of MNPI, and general outbound marketing. Team members can edit the site content at any time given a corresponding entry in the log below. This excludes releasing (or making minor edits to) blog posts, which can also include outside contributors.
