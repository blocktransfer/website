# What is centralized?

While the root directory site here is open-source and avaliable for the general public to comment, audit, and interact with&mdash;**the main www.blocktransfer.com website is centralized.**

We currently host this content through Zoho, which the Syndicate uses to manage sensative internal operations such as emergency regulatory communications, management of MNPI, and general outbound marketing.

You can see the results of these operations through our public financial disclosures and such. While all endingeering occurs on GitHub,[^fraud] you can learn more about working directly at the centralized company [here](https://www.blocktransfer.com/about/values). Generally, team members only can post Syndicate [releases](https://www.blocktransfer.com/blog).

[^fraud]: Fraud detection like on-chain account takeover scripts TBD&mdash;may be internal, but that will get disclosed elsewhere.
