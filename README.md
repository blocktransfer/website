# Eliminating Wall Street's Hidden Costs

In the world of investments, where transactions occur in the blink of an eye, the intricacies of Wall Street's operations often remain hidden from the average investor. However, as technology continues to advance, a new dawn is breaking, revealing the hidden costs and complexities that have long been overshadowed. Enter blockchain technology and the transformative potential it brings to the realm of capital markets.

## Peeling Back the Layers: The Journey of an Order

When you submit an order to buy or sell a stock, it embarks on a complex journey before execution, with each intermediary along the way extracting its own share of fees. Let's dissect this journey:

1. **Internalization Agents:** Your order arrives at your broker's doorstep. Instead of being executed directly, it may first be routed to internalization agents, who process the trade on behalf of the broker. These agents handle the transaction within the broker's own systems, potentially leading to execution at a price slightly less favorable to you and padding the pockets of intermediaries.

2. **Routing Agents:** From there, your order might move to routing agents, specialized in navigating the intricate network of stock exchanges and marketplaces. While their goal is to secure the best possible price for your trade, their involvement introduces additional complexity and potential fees.

3. **Exchanges and Market Makers:** Once your order reaches an exchange, it encounters market makers, who facilitate transactions by matching buyers and sellers. These market makers pocket the difference between the buy and sell prices, known as the spread. In addition, the trade might encounter multiple exchanges, each with its own rules and fees.

4. **Clearing Agents:** Successful trades are then passed to clearing agents, who ensure that both parties meet their obligations, verifying the financial capabilities of each participant. This step is crucial for settling the trade and transferring ownership, but it comes with its own set of charges.

5. **Depository Agents and Settling Banks:** The trade's journey continues with depository agents, who maintain records of share ownership, and settling banks, responsible for processing funds and securities. These entities play a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth settlement of the trade, but their involvement also adds to the accumulating costs.

6. **Another Broker:** If your broker isn't directly connected to the trade, the process might loop back, involving another broker who handles the final transaction. This adds another layer of intermediaries and potential fees.

## A Historical Perspective: From Physical Transfers to High-Frequency Trading

To truly comprehend the origins of this intricate web of intermediaries, we need to rewind the clock. In the early days of stock trading, physical presence was essential to transfer shares. Investors had to travel to company offices, pay significant fees, and obtain board approval for a transfer. Even when stock futures emerged as an alternative, credit risks posed challenges.

As history unfolded, brokers assumed the role of intermediaries, simplifying the process but often conflicting with investor interests. High-frequency trading emerged, allowing market makers to profit from minute price differences. These practices shaped the modern investment landscape we see today.

## The Birth of Block Transfer: Transforming Investment Dynamics

Amidst this complexity, blockchain technology emerges as a game-changer. Block Transfer represents a paradigm shift in investment interactions. By leveraging blockchain, the middlemen are replaced with transparency, efficiency, and fairness. The blockchain's decentralized structure ensures immediate transaction execution and significantly reduces costs.
