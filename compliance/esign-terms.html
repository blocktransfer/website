    <h2>eSignature Terms</h2>
    <h3>Last updated on August 13, 2023</h3>
	  
	  <p>Block Transfer uses digital signatures associated with your public wallet address to verify instructions from you. Your digital account certificate is the private segment of a public key generated using an elliptic curve during account onboarding.</p>
	  
	  <p>We consider your algorithmic elliptic-curve cryptographic digital signature as certified written authorization of any signed instructions, in compliance with our signature guarantee program.</p>
	  
	  <p>You won't need any special system to access the documents or transactions you signâ€”only internet access.</p>
	  
	  <p>You will receive a message in our app that any transfer, private sale, or other instructions have been properly digitally signed and submitted to the Stellar network, where they take effect. You consent that receipt of such digital confirmation in our app equates to us physically mailing you a statement a statement transfer position change and effectiveness. If a transaction fails because of insufficient funds or other various reasons, we will also notify you in the app. You similarly agree that such notice equates to receiving a written, mailed communication.</p>
	  
	  <p>Block Transfer reserves the right to update and change, from time to time, these eSignature Terms and all documents incorporated by reference by posting updates and/or changes to our Website. It is your responsibility to check this page periodically for changes. Use of our platform after such changes constitutes acceptance of such changes. Any new features or tools added to the current platform shall also be subject to the eSignature Terms.</p>
