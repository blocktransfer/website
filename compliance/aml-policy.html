	  <h4>2: Client Identity Verification</h4>
	    
		<p>2.1 Block Transfer shall employ the Persona platform or other reliable means to verify the identities of all clients in accordance with the Client Identification Program (CIP) requirements outlined in the BSA.

	  <h4>3: Global AML and PEP List Scans</h4>
	    
		<p>3.1 To fortify defenses against money laundering and terrorist financing, Block Transfer shall conduct periodic and systematic scans against all global AML and Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) lists.
