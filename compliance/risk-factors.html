    <h3>About Stellar</h3>
      <h4>Underlying Technology</h4>
        <p>A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions between two parties in a verifiable and permanent way using cryptography. Transactions on the blockchain are verified and authenticated by computers on the network ("nodes" or "validators") that receive, propagate, verify, and execute transactions. The process of authenticating a transaction before it is recorded ensures that only valid and authorized transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain in collections of transactions called "blocks." Blockchain networks are based upon software source code that establishes and governs their respective cryptographic systems for verifying transactions. The recording of Issuer Assets on the blockchain will not fundamentally affect the valuations of issuer securities.</p>
      
      <h4>Ownership Rights</h4>
        <p>Controllable electronic records have the same rights, preferences, and privileges as traditional securities of the same class, but settle differently than securities transacted in the NMS. Controllable electronic records are uncertificated, registered securities, the ownership and transfer of which are recorded on Stellar ledgers that is publicly distributed. We recognize ledger transfers on Stellar as material fact on issuer's securities register and capital books.</p>
      
      <h4>Data Integrity</h4>
        <p>Generally, distributed ledger technology involves multiple copies of a synchronized electronic database, or distributed ledger, that are separately maintained by various participants on a network. Complex cryptographic processes are employed across the distributed ledger network as the means by which participants on the network achieve a consensus as to which transactions are valid, and therefore, should be immutably recorded within the relevant distributed ledger.</p>
      
        <p>The validity of publicly available copies of the Stellar ledger can be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger network technology.</p>
      
      <h4>Possibility of Network Delays</h4>
        <p>Delays in transaction processing have occurred on the Stellar network. Such a delay may occur on account of, among other things, the inability of nodes to reach consensus on transactions. During a network delay, it will not be possible to record transactions in the securities on the blockchain. Should such a delay occur for an extended period of time, we could choose to effect transactions with securityholders manually (i.e., in book-entry form only) until such time as the network has resumed normal operation, whereby we are bound to standard three-day turnaround rules pursuant to Rule 17Ad-2 as promulgated by the SEC.</p>
      
      <h4>Suitability Risks</h4>
        <p>The suitability of the Stellar network (and its underlying Stellar ledger) on which Issuer Assets rely could decline due to a variety of causes, adversely affecting the functionality of Issuer Assets. The Stellar network is based on software protocols that govern the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected to these networks. The suitability of the Stellar network for the functionality of the securities depends upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The effectiveness of the informal groups of (often uncompensated) developers contributing to the protocols that underlie the network;</li>
          
          <li>Effectiveness of the validators and the network’s consensus mechanisms to effectively secure the network against confirmation of invalid transactions;</li>
          
          <li>The continued participation of a number of trusted validators;</li>
          
          <li>The lack of collusion between trusted validators;</li>
          
          <li>Disputes among the developers or validators of the network;</li>
          
          <li>Changes in the consensus or validation scheme that underlies the network;</li>
          
          <li>The failure of cybersecurity controls or security breaches of the network;</li>
          
          <li>The inability of validators to reach consensus and the consequential halting of transaction verification on the network;</li>
          
          <li>The existence of undiscovered technical flaws in the network;</li>
          
          <li>The development of new or existing hardware or software tools or mechanisms that could negatively impact the functionality of the systems;</li>
          
          <li>The price of Stellar Lumens, the asset associated with Stellar;</li>
          
          <li>The cost of transaction fees to use the Stellar network;</li>
          
          <li>Intellectual property rights-based or other claims against the network’s participants;</li>
          
          <li>The continued adoption of the Stellar network; and</li>
          
          <li>The maturity of the computer software programming software development kit ("SDK") used in connection with the network.</li>
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Investor Experience</h3>
      <h4>Account Creation</h4>
        <p>Upon the creation of an account, securityholders will create a blockchain wallet. Each investor is assigned a unique Stellar network blockchain address for their wallet, and they are able to track the balance of Issuer Assets in their wallet on a public "block explorer" tool capable of displaying activity on the Stellar network. Users of the Stellar network must pay transaction fees (in the form of "Stellar Lumens," the native digital asset for the operation of Stellar) to the Stellar network in order to validate a transaction. Such nominal transaction fees are intended to protect the Stellar network from frivolous or malicious computational tasks. Investors will not be required to purchase any Stellar Lumens. Upon registration, we provide all accounts with sufficient Stellar Lumens for ordinary interaction with Issuer Assets. Should more funds be needed, they will be provided on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion.</p>
    
      <h4>Traditional Account Control</h4>
        <p>The use of blockchain technology is relatively new and still evolving for securities registrars. Similar to traditional recordkeeping systems, all securityholder records in the blockchain integrated system are under our full and complete control. At any time and without prior notice, we may freeze your account through the Stellar network to comply with federal rulings, execute securities splits, investigate suspicious activity, or any other such time as we see fit.</p>
      
      <h4>Private Trading</h4>
        <p>You can privately trade controllable electronic records through the Stellar Decentralized Exchange ("SDEX"). This process is equivalent to a traditional book-entry securities transfer to another party in exchange for consideration. You do not need to participate in book-entry private trading. Your account will face no restrictions for exclusively trading securities in the National Market System ("NMS").</p>
      
      <h4>Reconciliation Risks</h4>
        <p>Because of the differences between the way the securities are issued and recorded as compared to securities in a traditional transfer agent, there is a risk that issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if traditional methods were involved may not be easily resolved for the Issuer Assets. The occurrence of any related issue or dispute could have a material adverse effect issuer securities valuations.</p>
    
    <h3>Social Risks</h3>
      <p>There are risks associated with the issuance, redemption, transfer, custody and record keeping of securities maintained and recorded on Stellar. For example, securities that are issued using Stellar are subject to the following risks (among others):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>a rapidly-evolving regulatory landscape in the United States and in other countries, which might result in security, privacy or other regulatory concerns that could require changes to the way transactions in the securities are recorded;</li>
      
        <li>the possibility of undiscovered technical flaws in our proprietary system or an underlying technology, including in the process by which transactions are recorded to Stellar, or by which the validity of a copy of such ledger can be proven;</li>
          
        <li>the possibility that cryptographic or other security measures that authenticate prior transactions for a ledger could be compromised, or "hacked," which could allow an attacker to alter Stellar and thereby disrupt the ability to corroborate definitive transactions recorded on Stellar;</li>
        
        <li>the possibility that new technologies or services inhibit access to Stellar;</li>
        
        <li>the possibility that a breach to Stellar could cause investors, and the public generally, to lose trust in Stellar and increase reluctance to issue and invest in assets recorded on Stellar; and</li>
        
        <li>because of the differences between the way the securities are issued and recorded as compared to traditional securities, there is a risk that issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if traditional methods were involved may not be easily resolved for the securities. The occurrence of any related issue or dispute could have a material adverse effect on Issuer Assets.</li>
      </ol>
    
    <h3>Global Regulation</h3>
      <h4>Uncertain Policies</h4>
        <p>Blockchain networks currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United States but also in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union and China. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Stellar network and its users, developers and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions’ regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations, or directives may conflict with those of the United States or may directly and negatively impact Issuer Assets. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to investors.</p>
      
      <h4>Evolving Landscape</h4>
        <p>Regulations of digital assets, blockchain technologies, and digital asset platforms are currently developing and likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly among international, federal, state, and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the U.S. and in other countries are currently considering, or may in the future consider, laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact us, and thus securityholders. Failure by us to comply with any laws, rules, or regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences to Issuer Assets.</p>
    
    <h3>Private Trading Risks<h3>
      <h4>Limited Volume and Liquidity</h4>
        <p>Because controllable electronic records settle differently from traditional securities, such as securities of our issuers' securities traded on the NMS, our book-entry controllable electronic records are not be listed for trading on any stock exchange or through any other NMS trading platform. Controllable electronic records are issued on the Stellar network that is not registered with the SEC and transacted through holder-posted orders generated using cryptography. Moreover, only holders with access to a Stellar wallet, such as one provided by us, are able to buy and sell controllable electronic records on Stellar. Any disruption to the operations of Stellar would materially disrupt trading in, or potentially result in a complete halt in the trading of, controllable electronic records.</p>
      
      <h4>Issuer Requirements</h4>
        <p>Unlike NMS trading platforms, there are no minimum price or other listing requirements for controllable electronic records to be traded on the SDEX. As a result, trades of controllable electronic records on the SDEX may not be at prices that represent the national best bid or offer prices of securities that could be considered similar securities.</p>
      
      <h4>Seperate Order Book</h4>
        <p>The price of controllable electronic records, even when we issue equity controllable electronic records that rank on a parity with issuers' NMS securities, is not pegged to the value of our issuers' NMS securities.</p>
        
        <p>Fungible controllable electronic records can be converted or exchanged for traditional securities of the same class trading on the NMS. Notwithstanding, controllable electronic records may have significantly different pricing associated with the different trading environment for controllable electronic records as compared to securities trading the NMS. The following factors may drive such a pricing differential between our securities trading on the NMS and our equivalent book-entry controllable electronic records transacted between holders using the SDEX:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>delays and fees associated with transfer from "street name" to direct registration;</li>
            
          <li>lower volume and liquidity of the digital securities on a closed trading system;</li>
            
          <li>immediate settlement of the digital securities compared to traditional T+2 settlement; and</li>
          
          <li>novelty of the controllable electronic record trading platform.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <h4>Disintermediation Risks</h4>      
        <p>Private trades of controllable electronic records do not require the involvement of a central depositary, broker, ATS, or us. Rather, controllable electronic records are directly held and traded by their direct-registered owners on the Stellar ledger, which are publicly published. The transaction costs associated with this process relate to the de minimis costs of Stellar network transactions conducted by holders in the event of transfer, private sale, or the like. As a result, Block Transfer—rather than clients or holders of controllable electronic records—will bear such minimal costs required in connection with embedding cryptographic hash functions in the Stellar blockchain. The validity of publicly available copies of the Stellar ledger can then be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger network technology.</p>
      
      <h4>Liquidity Risks</h4>
        <p>Because controllable electronic records are traded exclusively on a company's books, it is likely that there will be a limited number of holders of controllable electronic records. As a result, the SDEX may have limited liquidity, resulting in a lower or higher price or greater volatility than would be the case with greater liquidity. You may not be able to resell your controllable electronic records on a timely basis or at all.</p>
        
      <h4>Manipulation Risks</h4>
        <p>The number of controllable electronic records traded on the Stellar blockchain may be very small, making the market price more easily manipulated.</p>
        
        <p>While Block Transfer has adopted policies and procedures such that digital security holders are not free to manipulate the trading price of controllable electronic records contrary to applicable law, and while the risk of market manipulation exists in connection with the trading of any securities, the risk may be greater for controllable electronic records because the SDEX is a new system that does not have the same breadth of market and liquidity as the NMS. There can be no assurance that the efforts of Block Transfer will be sufficient to prevent such market manipulation. For example, there can be no assurance that multiple securityholders will not be able to manipulate securities price by opening multiple accounts and trading amongst themselves.</p>
      
      <h4>Novel System</h4>
        <p>Controllable electronic records privately trade using novel distributed ledger technology.</p>
        
        <p>The SDEX is subject to all the usual risks associated with the fact it was only created in PUT_SDEX_ORIGIN_YEAR_HERE_TODO, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a rapidly-evolving regulatory landscape, which might include security, privacy or other regulatory concerns that could require Block Transfer to implement changes to its controllable electronic records trading system that could disrupt trading in controllable electronic records;</li>
            
          <li>the possibility of undiscovered technical flaws in the Stellar network, including in the process by which transactions are recorded or by which the validity of a copy of the global ledger can be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger network technology;</li>
            
          <li>the possibility that cryptographic security measures that authenticate transactions and Stellar ledgers could be compromised, which could allow an attacker to alter the distributed ledger and thereby disrupt the ability to corroborate definitive transactions; and</li>
          
          <li>the possibility of breakdowns and trading halts as a result of flaws in Stellar that could prevent trades for a period of time.</li>
        </ul>
      
    <h3>Privacy Risks</h3>
      <h4>Public Distributed Ledgers</h4>
        <p>Copies of the distributed ledger are available to the public and will store the complete trading history from inception of the issuance of each series of controllable electronic records. As a result, robust and transparent trading data, other than holder identity, with respect to controllable electronic records are publicly available via the published proprietary and distributed ledgers. The controllable electronic records trading data is secured by cryptographic key pairs and only the public-key-derived wallet address is exposed to the public on the distributed ledger. The personal identity information necessary to associate a public key representing a given block of controllable electronic records with the owner thereof are maintained in a separate database that is not exposed to the public. A security breaches with respect to the personal identity information database would reveal public keys mapped to personal identities. Moreover, concerns over these privacy issues may limit adoption of the SDEX by a range of potential investors, reducing liquidity of controllable electronic records.</p>
        
        <p>The Stellar network will automatically publish to the internet information necessary to prove the validity of any book-entry transaction of controllable electronic records. This process ensures that anyone with basic cryptographic technical skills will have access on a near real-time basis to the embedded data necessary to prove the validity of any publicly available copy of the Stellar ledger. As a result, there is robust and transparent trading data (specifically, the number of securities traded by each anonymized account, the price of each trade, and the balance of the securities held in each anonymized account) available to the general public. In addition, Block Transfer matches holders to transactions recorded on Stellar. As a result, Block Transfer has all information necessary to complete clients' capital books and records with respect to each controllable electronic record transaction (specifically, the identity of each digital security's owner, the number of securities traded in each transaction, the price of each trade and the balance of securities held by each owner).</p>
      
      <h4>Private Cryptographic Keys</h4>
        <p>Controllable electronic records are represented by balances written on Stellar and secured by cryptographic associated key pairs. The associated private key is necessary to effect the sale of a given block of our digital securities and, as such, is meant to be kept private. The general public, however, is not yet accustomed to using secure cryptographic methods and managing private keys.</p>
        
        <p>Transactions in controllable electronic records are recorded on Stellar, which are electronically published on a real time basis. The Stellar ledger reflects the definitive ownership record with respect to controllable electronic records. The validity of publicly available copies of the Stellar ledger can be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger network technology. If, for any reason, the distributed ledger technology utilized with respect to a series of controllable electronic records were to become unavailable and suitable alternative technology were not available to be implemented, investors in such controllable electronic records would not have a means of proving the validity of publicly-available copies of the proprietary ledger. As a result, the accuracy of publicly-available trading information could be called into question and investors may elect to no longer transact in controllable electronic records.</p>
