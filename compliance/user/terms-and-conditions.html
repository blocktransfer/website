        <li>initiated by any person (or that person’s agent) who is the owner or co-owner of any account as registered;</li>

    <h3>Content Rights</h3>
      <p>All aspects of our Website are protected by U.S. and international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. No material on our platform may be reused in any way whatsoever. The Block Transfer logos are proprietary images of Block Transfer, and the use of those marks is strictly prohibited.</p>
      
      <p>You do not acquire any ownership rights in any material protected by intellectual property laws.</p>
      
    <h3>We are a Securities Transfer Agent</h3>
      <p>Every security is different. Therefore, individual results for issuers may vary widely. We do not promise, guarantee, or warrant the appreciation of any serviced securities. All investments carry some degree of risk. All securities can lose all their value if market conditions sour. Investment in the securities of smaller companies can involve greater risk than is generally associated with investment in larger, more established companies, risks that can result in significant capital losses.</p>
      
      <h4>No Investment Advice</h4>
        <p>The investments and services offered by us may not be suitable for all investors. If you have any doubts as to the merits of an investment, you should seek advice from an independent financial advisor. You should only trade in financial products that you understand completely. Carefully consider your investment experience, financial situation, investment objective, risk tolerance level and consult your independent financial adviser as to the suitability of your situation prior making any investment. You agree that we are not liable for any and all losses you experience including taxes and capital losses.</p>
    
      <h4>No Tax Advice</h4>
        <p>Regardless of any transaction reporting forms we send you, we do not offer any tax or accounting advice. You should consult your accountant, attorney, or other necessary professional for advice on these topics. You are solely and exclusively responsible for complying with any and all applicable laws and regulations in your investments. We shall have no liability for your violation of any laws. You are solely and exclusively responsible for collecting and reporting any and all capital gains, dividend, and any other taxes. <strong>We are not responsible for collecting or reporting your capital gains.</strong> You agree to indemnify us in the event that you violates any law.</p>
    
      <h4>Service Availability</h4>
        <p>Except where otherwise inapplicable or prohibited by law, our platform and all content and subsidiaries thereof are provided on an "as is", "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of title or implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. We make no, and expressly disclaim any and all, representations and warranties as to the reliability, timeliness, quality, suitability, availability, accuracy, and/or completeness of any information on this website. We do not represent or warrant, and expressly disclaim that our platform will:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>be secure, timely, uninterrupted, or error-free,</li>
          <li>meet your requirements or expectations,</li>
          <li>be entirely free of harmful components,</li>
          <li>accurately store user data, or</li>
          <li>have any errors corrected.</li>
        </ol>
    
    <h3>Limitations of Liabilities</h3>
      <p>Except where otherwise inapplicable or prohibited by law, in no event shall we or anyone associated with us including our officers and directors be liable for any damages arising from or related to our platform, regardless of whether we had notice of the possibility of any such damages. This applies regardless of the manner in which damages are allegedly caused, and on any theory of liability. In no event shall our liability to you exceed zero dollars.</p>
    
    <h3>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h3>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to a trial by jury. The rights that you or your business would have if you went to court, such as discovery or the right to appeal, may be more limited or may not exist. You agree that you and your business may only bring a claim in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff (lead or otherwise) or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You further agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
      
      <p>You understand that you or your business would have had a right to litigate through a court, to have a judge or jury decide your case, and to be party to a class or representative action. However, you understand and agree to have any claims decided individually and only through binding, final, and confidential arbitration in accordance with this arbitration provision.</p>
      
      <h4>Limited Peers</h4>
        <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these terms as a court would.</p>
      
      <h4>Supportive Solution</h4>
        <p>If you have a complaint, dispute, or controversy, you agree to first contact us to attempt to resolve the dispute or controversy informally. Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of our platform that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be resolved by binding, confidential arbitration</p>
      
      <h4>Arbitrator</h4>
        <p>The arbitration will be conducted virtually in English by a single neutral arbitrator. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and Mediation Procedures, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration.</p>
      
      <h4>Authority</h4>
        <p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement,</li>
          <li>whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or us, and</li>
          <li>determine whether any dispute is arbitrable,</li>
          <li>resolve any dispute</li>
        </ol>
      
      <h4>Compensation</h4>
        <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s Rules. In all other respects, the parties shall each pay their own additional costs.</p>
      
      <h4>Finality</h4>
        <p>Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
      
      <h4>No Class Action</h4>
        <p>You and Block Transfer agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. You and Block Transfer expressly waive any right to pursue any class or other representative action against each other.</p>
      
      <h4>Timing</h4>
        <p>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other claims except that all claims must be brought within one year after the claim arises (the one year period includes the 120-day informal resolution procedures described above).</p>
      
      <h4>Other</h4>
        <p>This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</p>
        
        <p>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with us, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
    
    <h3>Additional Remedies</h3>
      <p>In order to prevent or limit irreparable injury to Block Transfer, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by you of the provisions of this Agreement or any infringement or threatened infringement by you of the intellectual property of Block Transfer or a third-party, Block Transfer shall be entitled to seek a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions or other equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction located in Kent County, Delaware restraining such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as prohibiting us from pursuing in court any other remedies available to it for such breach, threatened breach, infringement, or threatened infringement, including the recovery of monetary damages from you and your business. You and your business hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, the courts of Ada County, Idaho for all such claims, and forever waive any challenge to said courts’ exclusive jurisdiction or venue.</p>
    
    <h3>Legal</h3>
      <h4>Third-Party Links</h4>
        <p>Our platform may contain links to other websites. Block Transfer assumes no responsibility for the content or functionality of any outside website to which we provide a link.</p>
    
      <h4>Effect Period</h4>
        <p>This Agreement will take effect (or shall re-take effect) at the time you click "Continue", or similar links or buttons; otherwise submit information through our platform; respond to a request for information; begin installing, accessing, or using our platform; or complete any transaction. If, in our sole discretion, you fail, or we suspect that you have failed, to comply with any Condition of Use, we may terminate or suspend your access to our platform at any time without notice to you. Any representations, warranties, and other obligations made or undertaken by you, shall survive the termination of your account.</p>
    
      <h4>No Waiver</h4>
        <p>No failure or delay on the part of Block Transfer in exercising any right, power or remedy may operate as a waiver, nor may any single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power, or remedy, or the exercise of any other rights, power, or remedy under this Agreement. A waiver of any right or obligation under this Agreement shall only be effective if in writing and signed by Block Transfer.</p>
    
      <h4>Governing Law/Venue</h4>
        <p>The Conditions of Use and any issue or dispute arising out of or otherwise related shall be governed exclusively by the laws of State of Delaware without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. To the extent that any claim or dispute is found by the arbitrator or (if proper) a court of competent jurisdiction to be excluded from the arbitration agreement above, the parties agree any such claim or dispute shall be exclusively brought in and decided by the state or federal courts located in Kent County, DE, and you hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of, and exclusive venue in, such courts, and forever waive any challenge to said courts' exclusive jurisdiction or venue.</p>
    
      <h4>Force majeure</h4>
        <p>Block Transfer will not be responsible to you for any delay, damage, or failure caused or occasioned by any act of nature or other causes beyond our reasonable control.</p>
    
      <h4>Assignment</h4>
        <p>Block Transfer may assign its rights at any time, without notice to you. Your rights arising cannot be assigned without our express written consent.</p>
    
      <h4>Servility</h4>
        <p>If any provision of our Conditions of Use is found to be invalid or unenforceable by the arbitrator or a proper court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby and shall continue in full force and effect and such provision may be modified to the extent necessary to make such provision enforceable.</p>
    
    <h3>Backup Witholding</h3>  
      <p>Tax laws require that you certify your tax information when you invest in securities that pay a dividend. Under these laws, you may be subject to federal backup withholding at 24%, and state backup withholding may also apply, on a portion of your taxable distributions unless you:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>provide your correct Social Security or taxpayer identification number,</li>
        <li>certify that you are a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien),</li>
        <li>certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, and</li>
        <li>certify that this number is correct.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Block Transfer must also withhold if the IRS instructs it to do so. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the appropriate information is furnished to the IRS. Certain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding and information reporting.</p>
    
    <h4>Certain Foreign Investors</h4>
      <p>Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. withholding and estate tax, and are subject to special U.S. tax certification requirements. In general, the United States imposes a flat 30% withholding tax (or a tax at a lower treaty rate) on U.S. source dividends. Exemptions from U.S. withholding tax are provided for various reasons, unless you are a nonresident alien individual present in the U.S. for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year.</p>
      
    
    <p>However, notwithstanding such exemptions from U.S. withholding tax at source, any taxable distributions will be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% if you fail to properly certify that you are not a U.S. person.</p>
