    <p>Block Transfer uses digital signatures associated with your public wallet address to verify instructions from you. Your digital account certificate is the private segment of a public key generated using an elliptic curve during account onboarding. We consider your digital signature as certified written authorization of any signed instructions. You can view a more complete description of this process <a href="/../signature-guarantees.html">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h4>E-Delivery Consent</h4>
      <p>By opting for eDelivery of tax documents, investor notices, or any other account transaction information including support or digital attestations related thereto; you consent that email delivery of such documents to your provided address equates to written mailed communication of such material in a timely manner.</p>
