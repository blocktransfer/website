    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>Last Updated on October 30, 2022</h3>
	  
	    <p>BlockTrans Syndicate (referred to herein as “Block Transfer”, "we", "our") reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice. The last revision date is identified above. You are responsible for periodically checking this page for any changes. Use of our platform after such changes constitutes acceptance of such changes.</p>
	  
	  
	  <h4>Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
	  
		<p>Block Transfer may collect two different types of information, Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”). PII that we collect is information that identifies you as an individual – and includes your name, address, email address, physical address, direct deposit information, and federal tax identification number. Non-PII is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses, user behavior data from web interaction metrics tools, your Stellar public address, and other information that does not reveal your specific identity. PII and Non-PII may be collected at any time when you access or use Block Transfer's website. PII and Non-PII may also be collected by Block Transfer during in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or other written communications including live chat and email tickets. On certain issuer webpages, Block Transfer also collects information via cookies to track marketing conversions.</p>
		
		<p>Anyone can see your full account history, including all private sales executed using the Stellar Decentralized Exchange, as associated with you Stellar public address (GEXAMPLEKMHSY4...4H72C7TRWVX5NADDRESS) or an account nickname address, optionally defined by you during signup (happy.shareholder*blocktransfer.com). By interacting with your account wallet, you consent that this information be made public and associated with your account address on the Stellar distributed ledger. Your automatic pseudorandom account address does not reveal any of your PII, but you may choose to include PII in your nickname address. You consent that Block Transfer is not liable for any and all incidents due in any way to your identity being linked to your account, including due to the use of a public nickname address with PII.</p>
		
		<p>Generally, you control the amount and type of information you provide to us when using our website. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interaction with Block Transfer's website, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. Block Transfer uses PII to respond to your inquiries, provide you with services you have requested, keep you informed of corporate updates for securities you hold, otherwise personalize your experience with Block Transfer, and other reasons. Block Transfer does not sell or lease PII about you to others, and may in some cases be liable for so doing under the Privacy Shield Framework outlined below. Block Transfer shares your PII with issuers as described in the Client Terms available at https://www.blocktransfer.com/terms. Third parties contracting with Block Transfer to provide services to you, including financial institutions, integrators you have chosen including Plaid, and other third party software services that you have consented to associate with your account by adding. Block Transfer employees who design our databases and software, client service staff, and our client service software partners also have access to PII as part of their job to provide you services.</p>
		
		<p>Block Transfer reserves the right to disclose and use your PII if Block Transfer believes it is necessary to: respond to legal process; satisfy legislative requirements; respond to a law enforcement agency’s request including the FBI and FinCEN; enforce the Terms; or protect the rights, privacy, safety, property, or operations of Block Transfer or third parties, including instances where Block Transfer at its sole discretion suspects financial crime or money laundering. Because Non-PII does not personally identify You, Block Transfer reserves the right to use and disclose to third parties Non-PII for any purpose.</p>
		
		<p>Block Transfer maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect PII from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Block Transfer enforces its Privacy Policy via self-assessment. If a shareholder links a financial adviser to their wallet, block transfer may discuss the investor's personal information with such adviser.</p>

Computershare will assist our data controller clients, to the extent possible, with the fulfillment of their obligations to respond to your requests.

	  <h4>Public Keys</h4>
	    
		<p>The Stellar ledger is available to the public and will store the complete transaction history from issuance of the Issuer Assets. As a result, robust and transparent data, other than shareholder personal identifying information, will be publicly available via block explorers. Accordingly, data regarding the issuance and redemption of various Issuer Assets (and not a shareholder’s personal identifying information) will be exposed to the public. We maintain the PII necessary to associate a given security with the record owner of that security in a separate, traditional database that is not available to the public. However, if there are data security breaches resulting in theft of the information necessary to link personal identities with Issuer Assets, the stolen information could be used to determine an investor's identity and complete investing history in Issuer Assets. </p>
		
		<p>Moreover, outside actors may be able to resolve your public key to your identity based on (i) a public transaction history that matches your public investing profile or (ii) user-provided PII used in wallet federation address. You consent that we are not liable for any damages, materialized or not, which result in anyone knowing the full and total trading, transfer, and miscellaneous public history of your account.</p>
		
		
	  <h4>Ownership</h4>
	    
		<p>In most cases, if mail is returned as undeliverable we are required to take certain steps to try to find you free of charge. If these attempts are unsuccessful, however, we may deduct the costs of any additional efforts to find you from your account at our sole discretion, namely state escheatment fees. These costs may include a percentage of the account when a search company charges a percentage fee in exchange for its location services.</p>
		
		<p>Payments including dividends may be sent to you by electronic funds transfer ("ACH"). Neither Block Transfer nor its agents shall be liable to you or any other person if, for any reason, a redemption request by ACH is not processed properly.</p>
		
		<p>In the event of disputes involving conflicting claims of ownership or authority to control your Issuer Assets, we have the right (but has no obligation) to: (i) restrict the shares and require the written agreement of all persons deemed by us to have a potential interest in the Issuer Assets before executing instructions regarding the Issuer Assets; or (ii) interplead disputed Issuer Assets or the proceeds from the court-ordered sale thereof with a court of competent jurisdiction. Should the Fund be required to defend against joint or multiple shareholders in any action relating to an ownership dispute, you expressly grant us the right to obtain reimbursement for costs and expenses including, but not limited to, attorneys’ fees and court costs, by unilaterally disposing of Issuer Assets from your account.</p>
		
		<p>We may be required (i) pursuant to a validly issued levy, garnishment or other form of legal process, to sell your Issuer Assets and remit the proceeds to a levying officer or other recipient; or (ii) pursuant to a final order of forfeiture or other form of legal process, to sell your shares and remit the proceeds to the U.S. or state government as directed.</p>
		
		<p>As long as we or our agents follow reasonable security procedures and act on instructions we or our agents reasonably believe are genuine, we and our agents will not be responsible for any losses that may occur from unauthorized requests in any form (written, telephone, online, etc.). We will investigate any unauthorized request that you report to us and we will ask you to cooperate with us in the investigation, which may require you to file a police report and complete a notarized affidavit regarding the unauthorized request. We will assist in the claims process, on your behalf, with other financial institutions regarding the unauthorized request.</p>
		
		<p>Using good faith efforts, we attempt to identify class action litigation settlements and regulatory or governmental recovery funds involving bankruptcy proceedings related to issuers, class action litigation settlements, and regulatory or governmental recovery funds involving present or former Issuer Assets ("Claims") in which we may be eligible to participate. When such Claims are identified, the we will file proofs of claim. Currently, such Claim opportunities predominate in the U.S. and in Canada; our efforts are therefore focused on Claim opportunities in those jurisdictions. The investment manager may learn of such class action lawsuit or victim fund recovery opportunities in jurisdictions outside of North America ("Foreign Actions"), in which case we have complete discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to file proofs of claim in such Foreign Actions.</p>
