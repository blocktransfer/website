  <h2>Institutional Vote Reporting</h2>
    <p><strong>The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 Section 14A(a)</strong> requires that all <strong>Exchange Act Section 13(f)</strong> institutional securityholders report how they voted on <em>say-on-pay</em> votes at least annually.</p>
    
    <p>Block Transfer accounts for votes directly on the blockchain through its <strong>Shareholder Voting System</strong>, as detailed in <a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/20220284507">US Patent Application Publication 20220284507A1</a>. In this system, votes are recorded as memo text on the Stellar network, using strings such as <strong>Yay/Nay/Abstain ("Y,N,A")</strong> votes on issuer-generated ballots.</p>
    
    <p>As a result, institutional book-entry shareholders subject to the legal requirement of disclosing investment voting history can simply reveal their account public key. Anyone can then easily observe what they voted on by examining the public transaction memos sent to Block Transfer's established voting addresses. If you're unfamiliar with finding such votes via a block explorer, you can also reach out to us at <a href="mailto:support@blocktransfer.com?subject=Voting%20History%20Inquiry%20for%20Company%20X%20(Account%20Y)&body=Hello%20Block%20Transfer%20Support%2C%0A%0AI%20am%20inquiring%20about%20disclosing%20my%20investment%20voting%20history%20as%20per%20the%20disclosures%20required%20by%20the%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Act%20of%201934%20Section%2014A(a)%20for%20my%20company%20%22X%22%20with%20account%20number%20%22Y%22.%20Please%20assist%20me%20with%20the%20process.%0A%0AThank%20you%2C%0A%5BYour%20Name%5D">support@blocktransfer.com</a> or consult our <a href="https://api.blocktransfer.com/federation">Federation server</a>.</p>
