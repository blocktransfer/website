The TAD concept was envisioned as an ideal, efficient, and decentralized certificate trading system between transfer agents who, at the time, didn't have the operational capacity to build its technology. TAD3 is a completed realization of this system, allowing for seamless stock records on a Stellar distributed ledger. The underlying open-source technology puts transfers, trading, and voting directly in your hands through a non-custodial wallet."
